# MWT_model

The presented repository contains a Simulink model for experimental wind generator based on Magnus effect. 

MWT_model_input.m file contains input parameters for simulation which can be tuned to a current configuration of the wind generator. 
MWT_model_simulink.slx file contains simulink model with different variations of wind and cylinder speeds.

This project is currently in work and repository will be further updated to include new and improved models of the Magnus effect-based wind generator.
