# MWT_model

The presented repository contains a Simulink model for experimental wind generator based on Magnus effect. 

MWT_model_input.m file contains input parameters for simulation which can be tuned to a current configuration of the wind generator. 
MWT_model_simulink.slx file contains simulink model with different variations of wind and cylinder speeds.
